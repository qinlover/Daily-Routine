## 如何用英语描述剪头发
Hello everbody!

In today's video, I will get a hiarcut at the hair salon.

And if you are a woman, you will get a hair cut at the salon. But if you are a man, you will get a haircut at the barbershop.

**Hair salon**: <u>A place where people go to get their hair done.</u>

In this video, I will first visit this hair calon behind me to get a haircut. And then I will go to a barbershop to show you how man normally cut their hair.

**Hair stylist**:<u> Someone who cuts, styles, and colors hair.</u>

So if you go to a hair salon to get a haicut, you will get a haircut with a hairstylist or a haridresser. And if you're a man and you go to the barbershop, you'll get your hair cut with a barber.

To get a haircut, you need to make an appointment.

Yesterday, I walked into the store and I went over here to the counter and I made an appointment for today at 12:00 p.m.

You can't just walk into the store and just get a haircut at that same moment.

**Appointment**: <u>Schedule a time to get a haircut.</u>

You have to make an appointment and schedule a time with the hair stylist to cut your hair.
