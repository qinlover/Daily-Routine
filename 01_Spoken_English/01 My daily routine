Hello, everybody!
It's Aringa, and welcome back to my YouTube channel.
In today's video, I will teach all of you vocabulary related to daily routines. 
I will show you all of the activities I do in my everyday life, and you might have the same activities. 
As you just saw, I just woke up; I'm still wearing my pajamas, or my PJs. 
I normally start my morning around 8:00 a.m. and I wake up to the sound of my alarm clock.
I'm not a morning person, so sometimes I will hit snooze on my alarm clock, 
and that's the button that will postpone the alarm, so I'll have an extra 5 or 10 minutes to sleep in. 
Then, after I wake up, I will get out of bed, so I will actually get up. 
I will stretch my arms, stretch my legs, 
and then I will head straight to the bathroom where I wash my face and then I will brush my teeth. 
Of course, every morning routine looks different, 
so if you want to get out of bed and then hop right into the shower, that's completely fine.

Now, I'll show you what my daily routine looks like, but now I have to take my dog on a walk. 
Right now, I'm outside, and this is something I do every morning. 
I take my dog, Ozuna, on a walk. 
If you have a dog like I do, you should go outside every morning to take your dog on a walk,
that way your dog won't pee or poop inside your house. 
When I go outside and go on a walk with my puppy, 
I always bring a bag, a plastic bag, in case he poops outside, that way I can pick it up and throw it in the trash. 
Now, if you do have a cat like I do, then you'll have a totally different routine in the morning. 
Cats pee and poop in the litter box, 
so you'll have to get a pooper scooper and scoop out the poop and the pee and put it in a plastic bag and then throw it away.
So, since I have a dog and a cat, my routine is a little bit complicated every single day 
because I have to take out my dog on a walk and I have to clean the litter box.

A big part of my daily routine, like yours, is learning a new language. 
You're learning English with me right now, and right now I'm actually working on improving my Spanish and picking up some Mandarin. 
And the best part is I can learn without even leaving my house thanks to today's sponsor, PrepLey.

You can use filters to find the perfect tutor for your level and budget and fit lessons into your busy schedule.

Let's get back to it now. It's time to eat breakfast.
So, some people in different parts of the world, they may skip breakfast or they might fast, 
but I normally like to eat breakfast because I don't want to leave the house on an empty stomach. 
So, in order to make breakfast, I will go to my fridge, open it, and see what kind of food I have.
I normally don't like to eat a typical American breakfast that consists of eggs, bacon, grits, and sausage.
I like eating fruits and veggies, or I like eating stuff from different cultures, like anpan, which I'm going to make right now.
Normally, it takes me around 10 to 15 minutes to make breakfast,
but let me know down below if you guys eat breakfast or do you fast and skip breakfast.

After eating breakfast, it's time to make the bed because, excuse me, I have to make the bed. 
Buddy the cat doesn't like when I make the bed. I just made the bed, and I like making my bed every morning because I like starting off my day with a clean room, so my bed looks clean, everything looks so organized, and now I can finally start my day. But I'm still in my pajamas, and now I have to get dressed. But I won't get dressed to go to work; I will get dressed in athletic gear because I'm going to the gym. But before going to the gym, let me know down below in the comments if you make your bed every morning.

I just walked to the gym, and right now I'm inside the gym. So I try to go to the gym almost every day, but sometimes I can't go because life does get busy. But today, I'm here at the gym to exercise and work out, so I'll do some physical activity. By the way, if you guys haven't watched my video about gym vocabulary, go ahead and check it out because I recorded that in this same gym. I usually work out for around 1 hour, and I like going to the gym because it makes me feel strong. I get stronger, I build my muscles, and I feel good. I look good, and it makes me feel less lazy. So, I'll work out for 1 hour, and then I'll head home.

Woo, I just finished working out. I'm all sweaty, I burned some calories, and also I feel a little bit sore. And now I have to go walk home and then go to work, but I'm still wearing my gym clothes. So when I go home, I will take a quick shower because I can't work in my gym clothes. And then I'll get dressed and go to work.

I just got out of the shower, and when you take a shower, you bathe yourself with soap and water. And as you can see, I have a towel wrapped around my head because I still need to dry my hair. Now I'm almost ready to go to work, but I still need to put on makeup on my face. So this is a very important step to my day because I like to look nice and professional when I go to work, and it's an important part of women's daily routines.

Now it's time to go to work, and you might be wondering, "Adan, where do you work? As an English teacher, do you work in an office? Do you have another job? What do you normally do?" Well, this is actually my workspace. I work on my computer. I work from home, so I basically edit all of my videos here, and I spend a lot of time editing my videos. Also, here I write my scripts, I brainstorm ideas, and I not only sit inside my house. I go to places to teach all of you guys English, and I'll be doing that in this video where I'll go to a park and I'll ask people what does their daily routine look like every day. As I said before, sometimes I work from home, but in order to record videos for you guys, I go to different places to teach all of you guys English.

So when I leave my house and go to these different places, I will have to drive a car, or I can use public transit like a train or a bus, or I can walk there. And this is called commuting. So the journey from leaving your house to going to that certain place to work is called your commute. My commute varies every single day. Sometimes I even have to drive 1 hour to get to a certain place to begin working. Let me know down below in the comments how long your commute is and do you normally drive to work, or do you take public transit like a train or bus, or do you walk to work.

So to prepare for the day, I usually like to pack things in a bag or in containers. For example, before I leave the house, I like to pack my microphones and a couple of snacks before I leave. But some people might pack a lunch if they work in an office or in a different place, and they pack a lunch if they can't come home for lunch.

Hi, what's your name? Alejandro. Hi, Alejandro. Can you tell me a little bit about your daily routine? My daily routine: I wake up, um, the first thing I do is I go for some coffee in the kitchen. Um, after I look for my coffee, I go and take a shower. After I take a shower, I go through my morning routine, just put cream, sunblock, and from there I get ready to go to work, Monday through Friday. That's what I usually do. And what time do you normally go to work? On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to work around 6:00 a.m. And Monday and Wednesday, Friday, I usually go at 10:00 a.m.

Hi, what's your name? Samantha. Hi, Samantha. Can you tell me a little bit about your daily routine? Sure, yeah. Every day I wake up around 7:00, and I go for a little bit of a walk in the morning, and then I get ready for work, eat breakfast, and then I drive down here. I work down here. I work right over there. I work for a little bit, and then I

pack a lunch if they can't come home for lunch hi what's your name Alejandro hi

Alejandro can you tell me a little bit about your daily routine my daily

routine I wake up um the first thing I do I go for some coffee in the kitchen

um after I look for my coffee I go and take a shower after I take a shower I go

through my morning routine just put cream Sun blog and from there I get

ready to go to work Monday through Friday that's what I usually do and what

time do you normally go to work on Tuesdays and Thursdays I go to work

around 6:00 a.m. and Monday and Wednesday Friday I usually go go 10:00

a.m. hi what's your name Samantha hi Samantha can you tell me a little bit

about your daily routine sure yeah um every day I wake up around 7:00 and I go

for a little bit of a walk in the morning and then I get ready for work

eat breakfast and then I drive down here I work down here I work right over there

I work for a little bit and then I try to go for a walk around lunchtime go to

the park get some sunshine and eat lunch and then around 4:00 I head home for the

day hi what's your name hi my name is earing hi arene what does your typical

daily routine look like I get up in the morning time I go to work I work at

Buffalo Wild Wings take my son to daycare get him come to practice showers

dinner bed and the same thing it sounds like you're busy what's your favorite

part about your daily routine um is spending time with my six-year-old son

awesome well thank you so much no problem I just asked a couple people

about what their daily routine looks like in English so let me know down

below what your routine looks like and what's your favorite part about your

routine normally after work maybe around 600 or 700 p.m. people like to stop by

fast food chains or restaurants to pick up something to eat but I personally

don't like eating out often because I feel like I cook a lot better and it's a

lot cheaper to eat at your house instead of buying something at a restaurant or

at a fast food chain so I'm going to walk back home now it's time to eat

lunch this is called lunchtime now if you work in an office or outside of your

house then you'll have around 30 to 60 Minutes every day to eat your lunch so

sometimes you might pack a lunch to work or you might cook food at your house and

bring it that's called packing your lunch or you might eat out in a

restaurant but since I work from home and I love cooking I will make lunch

right here in my kitchen [Music]

so an interesting fact about me is that when I cook I don't follow a recipe but

if I do follow a recipe I follow like five different recipes and I mix

everything together so sometimes I'll add different vegetables or fruits in my

recipes but I do think I am a pretty good Chef also I don't use a measuring

cup so I just taste my food and if it needs more salt or some more flavor then

I just add it I just finished making lunch and look how delicious my pasta

looks I am super hungry so if I did work in an office then I would pack my lunch

or bring in a container of food every single day because I like eating

home-cooked meals since I have the opportunity to work from home and make

lunch at home I like making my own lunch in my kitchen now I'm going to eat my

lunch Bona

Petit I've been awake since 8:00 a.m. I went to the gym I worked I took a shower

and now I need to take a quick nap to feel energized again so now I'll catch

you in a little bit I'll take a

[Music] nap by the way let me know down below if

you like to take naps see you in a little

bit I just woke up from my nap what time is it oh my gosh it's 4:00 p.m. normally

during this time if I don't take a nap on the couch or in my bed then I'll be

running errands so I might go to the store to get something that I need for

my house or I might be doing some household chores like watering my plants

cleaning up the living room vacuuming or even doing things for my personal life

like visiting my father and visiting my friends so basically people can run

errands during this time or they can do their favorite hobbies but honestly this

time depends on each person person for example some people might still be

working at this time or some people might be getting up to go to work for a

night shift right now I finished everything with work I don't have to run

any errands so I don't have to buy anything for my pets I don't have to

stop by the grocery store but during this time today it's really nice outside

so I'll take a walk with my dog once again and we're going to go to the park

and then we're going to get some ice cream

[Music]

during the summertime there's many activities you can do during the day for

example you can go to a soccer game a baseball game you can go to the pool or

you can even discover new hobbies some of my hobbies include playing sports I

enjoy playing volleyball and pickle ball right now I don't have any games to play

pickle ball or volleyball so that's why I'm here at the park let me know Down

Below in the comments your favorite hobby right now it's nighttime it's dark

out and I just ate dinner and I normally eat around 88 or 900 p.m. I kind of like

to eat a late dinner and then after dinner I like to wind down and watch

some TV I like to watch some YouTube some Netflix Hulu any kind of show or

movie I really like to relax also when I wind down I also like to scroll on my

phone so I'll go on Instagram Tik Tok Facebook and I'll watch videos funny

videos like memes but sometimes I don't want to watch any TV or even go on my

phone so I like to read a book I even like to play with my dog or my cat that

way I can just relax and just kind of Disconnect from the world for a little

bit I was watching a movie on the TV sorry for my yawn but I think it's

getting late and now I need to get ready to go to bed so before going to bed and

then falling asleep I need to change my clothes from my regular clothes into

pajamas or PJs and then I need to remove my makeup wash my face moisturize do my

skin care brush my teeth brush my hair take out my contacts because I wear

contacts in my eyes and then I'll be ready to go to bed but before going to

bed I still need to take out my dog on a walk so he doesn't pee or poop inside my

apartment and I probably have I've taken him out like five or six times a day

right now it's almost 11:00 and it's time to get in bed I'm sitting on the

bed but I am getting in bed by pulling the covers up and before I fall asleep I

will set an alarm for 8:00 a.m. on my watch that way I can do my daily routine

all over again tomorrow now it's time to fall asleep and also finish this video
